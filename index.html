            <h1>Healthcare is broken.</h1>

                    <p>There are a lot of problems in healthcare.  Big, complex problems.  And one of the biggest is that caregivers have an incomplete picture of patients' clinical data - leading to inaccurate diagnoses and inappropriate courses of treatment.</p>

                    <p>CareEvolution is working to solve this problem.  But we need talented <span class="emphasis">software engineers</span> - fulltime and interns - to join us in realizing our vision.</p>

              <h1>Meet Joe.</h1>
                        
              <p>One day, Joe got very sick. He went to the hospital and was admitted to the ER.  It turns out to be serious, and he was transferred to intensive care.</p>

              <p>A physician orders a few radiology images, and some labs, while Joe is in the ICU.  Joe has a couple of procedures done, and is transferred to regular inpatient.  Soon after, Joe gets better and is released, with a prescription - and he continues treatment as an outpatient, but at a separate clinic.</p>

            <div class="content">
              <p>During his stay, Joe came into contact with <i>at least</i> six different departments:  ER, ICU, Regular Inpatient, Radiology, Lab, and Pharmacy. And each department has its own Electronic Medical Records (EMR) system.</p>

                <p>Since the data is separate, the clinical picture is not clear.
                  Joe, for example, had an allergic reaction to Lorazepam.  This is important information for pharmacists - for this visit or for a visit ten years in the future.</p>

                <p><em>There is unrealized value in coupling data across EMRs.</em></p>
